PB2GameLauncher
This is game launcher for Plazma Burst 2 flash game. https://plazmaburst2.com
- x86 might not work on Linux, in case Adobe Flash Player version required to run game gets update that works over flash player version newer than 11. Because Adobe abandoned x86 support for Linux.
- As well Mac OS version wont be working in case game gets merged to Adobe Air SDK by Harman, as well as Launcher would need new code.
Why this?
- Eric Gurts launcher wont be working for Linux/Mac OS, thanks to .NET and Windows Forms.
- Currently launcher that is being used by official game is packaged electron app by Nyove. That is quite nice looking launcher, but it takes too much disk space, because it comes as bundled web-browser.
- This launcher comes lightweight because it does not bundle web-browser electron web app and do not use Microsoft bloatware.
